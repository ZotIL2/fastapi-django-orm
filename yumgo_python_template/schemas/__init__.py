"""
Schemas is the name for Pydantic models that are used for request and response bodies.

You can also use them as DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) to pass data between different parts of the application.

You can combine schemas with serializers from DRF (Django Rest Framework) or other libraries to convert data between different formats (from ORM to JSON, from JSON to ORM, etc.).
